# Mining-Architecture-Tactics-and-Quality-Attributes-Knowledge-in-Stack-Overflow
This work is about mining architecture tactic and quality attribute knowledge in Stack Overflow.


- 1. AT related terms.pdf
comprises AT names and their related terms. AT names are used for searching QA-AT posts, and AT related terms are used for dictionary training.

- 2. QA related terms
comprises QAs and their related terms. QAs are used for eight high-level QAs identification, and QA related terms are used for dictionary training.

- 3. QA-AT posts for classifier training.pdf
comprises the 1165 QA-AT posts and their URL links that were collected from Stack Overflow for classifier training.

- 4. The output of the trained dictionary.pdf
comprises the sensitive terms of QAs and ATs in the dictionary trained by the 1741 architectural posts.

- 5. QA-AT posts labelling and encoding.mx18
is the results of QA-AT posts labelling and encoding that were analyzed by the MAXQDA tool. We analyzed and coded the considerations discussed in QA-AT posts and the relationships between QAs and ATs. Particularly, the relationships between ATs and QAs can be found in the group named "ATs->QAs" in the coding results. The file can be opened by MAXQDA 2018 or higher versions, which are available at https://www.maxqda.com/ for download. You may also use the free 14-day trial version of MAXQDA 2018, which is available at https://www.maxqda.com/trial for download.
